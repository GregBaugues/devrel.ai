Hello sir! Stoked to chat next week about this stuff. 

Broadly, I'd love to chat with you about docs + AI. 

I'm gonna ask Ricky he wants to join. 

---- 

To the extent that I have a plan for devrel.ai, it goes something like this: 
* Poise of questions about where devrel is headed given AI 
* Use it as fodder to talk shop with friends and smart people 
* post the result of those conversations to devrel.ai in some capacity: 
	* at minimum an article that distills and/or incorporates the things we talked about (with your attribution)
	* maybe a cleaned up transcript of the conversation
	* maybe post the recording to youtube? 

Currently I'm primarily interested in 1 & 2. 

podcast/YT makes logical sense but I'm not sure juice is worth the squeeze for recorded zoom calls. 

Aiming for high-signal to noise on devrel.ai. Thinking more "playbook" than "blog." 

But we'll see.

I'm generally down to talk about anything you're excited/interested in, but for the sake of structure, here's where I'd start... 

A format that I've found so to work for me when writing about this stuff is: 

1. What's the old devrel playbook for X? 
2. What in AI is exciting to you? 
3. What's the new devrel playbook given X + AI? 

I can speak authoritatively on 1 and 2, which I feel gives some cover for the prophetic nature of 3.

# Old Playbook for Docs

* What makes for great docs? 
* What are some of the technical challenges of maintaining docs? 
	1. How do you pick a docs stack? 
	2. "docs as a product" 
	3. ? 
* How do you measure good docs? 
* How do you keep the docs in sync with the product? 
* What are some of the people challenges of owning the docs? 

# Questions about Docs + AI 

* Should your docs be [primarily markdown-based](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1914488029873627597)? 

* How do you structure docs to optimize for RAG over docs in the IDE? 
  
* Is it a failure case to have a developer look at documentation at all?
