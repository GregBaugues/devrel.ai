## Hello Andrew!

(this is a public but unlinked page. though the repo is public.)

Hello sir! Stoked to chat next week about this stuff. 

Broadly, I'd love to chat with you about docs + AI. 

I'll also ask Ricky if he wants to join.

# What is devrel.ai? 

To the extent that I have a plan for devrel.ai, it goes something like this: 

1. Poise of questions about where devrel is headed given AI 
2. Use it as fodder to talk shop with friends and smart people 
3. Post the result of those conversations to devrel.ai in some capacity: 

3 will be at minimum an article that distills and/or incorporates the things we talked about (with your attribution. Though I could see a cleaned up transcript, and **maybe** youtube? I dunno. It seems kind of dumb to have these conversations and *not* take the extra two steps to make it a podcast. 

But at minimum I want a page at devrel.ai/docs that has some strong advice/opinions from Andrew Baker with some sprinkles of my own ideas.

# What should we talk about? 

I'm generally down to talk about anything you're excited/interested in, but for the sake of structure, here's where I'd start... 

You ran docs at Twilio for a long time. There are few companies known for better docs, and few devtool companies that have more doc complexity. 

A format that I've found so to work for me when writing about devrel + AI is: 

1. What's the old devrel playbook for {tactic}? 
2. What's happening in AI that affects {tactic}? 
3. What's the new devrel playbook for {tactic} + AI? 

So here's how I'd propose structuring our conversation: 

----

## What's the old playbook for docs?

* What makes for great docs? 
* What are some of the technical challenges of maintaining docs? 
	1. How do you pick a docs stack? 
	2. "docs as a product" 
	3. ? 
* How do you measure good docs? 
* How do you keep the docs in sync with the product? 
* What are some of the people challenges of owning the docs? 


## What are you seeing in AI today that affects Docs? 



## Questions about Docs + AI 

* Should your docs be [primarily markdown-based](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1914488029873627597)? 

* How do you structure docs to optimize for RAG over docs in the IDE? 
  
* Is it a failure case to have a developer look at documentation at all?
