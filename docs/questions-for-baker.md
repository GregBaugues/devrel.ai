## Hello Andrew! 

(this is a public but unlinked page)

Hello sir! Stoked to chat next week about this stuff. 

Broadly, I'd love to chat with you about docs + AI. 

I'll also ask Ricky if he wants to join.

# What is devrel.ai? 

To the extent that I have a plan for devrel.ai, it goes something like this: 
* Poise of questions about where devrel is headed given AI 
* Use it as fodder to talk shop with friends and smart people 
* post the result of those conversations to devrel.ai in some capacity: 
	* at minimum an article that distills and/or incorporates the things we talked about (with your attribution)
	* maybe a cleaned up transcript of the conversation
	* maybe post the recording to youtube? 

Currently I'm primarily interested in 1 & 2. 

podcast/YT makes logical sense but I'm not sure juice is worth the squeeze for recorded zoom calls. 

Aiming for high-signal to noise on devrel.ai. Thinking more "playbook" than "blog." 

But we'll see. 


# What should we talk about? 

I'm generally down to talk about anything you're excited/interested in, but for the sake of structure, here's where I'd start... 

You ran docs at Twilio for a long time. There are few companies known for better docs, and few devtool companies that have more doc complexity. 

A format that I've found so to work for me when writing about devrel + AI is: 

1. What's the old devrel playbook for {tactic}? 
2. What's happening in AI that affects {tactic}? 
3. What's the new devrel playbook for {tactic} + AI? 

So here's how I'd propose structuring our conversation: 

----

## What's the old playbook for docs

* What makes for great docs? 
* What are some of the technical challenges of maintaining docs? 
	1. How do you pick a docs stack? 
	2. "docs as a product" 
	3. ? 
* How do you measure good docs? 
* How do you keep the docs in sync with the product? 
* What are some of the people challenges of owning the docs? 


## What are you seeing in AI today that affects Docs? 



## Questions about Docs + AI 

* Should your docs be [primarily markdown-based](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1914488029873627597)? 

* How do you structure docs to optimize for RAG over docs in the IDE? 
  
* Is it a failure case to have a developer look at documentation at all?
