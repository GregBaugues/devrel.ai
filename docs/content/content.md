# Old School Playbook

At Twilio, we wrote different content to target Organic traffic vs. Social traffic. A post called "How to Send SMS with Python" performs well in Google, whereas "How I taught my dog to text selfies" performs well on Hacker News. The former drives signups, the latter drives awareness. 

I conceptualize this split as "content a developer reads to solve a specific problem when they have an IDE open" and "content a developer reads on the toilet." 



# Organic


# Developer Social 




Here's how I thought about it. 

Write technical blog posts. 

Why are you writing? 
- Awareness
- Signups 




Developer Social
