# Greg Baugues

Hi! I'm Greg. I made this site. 

I spend most of my time building with AI, creating [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@gregcode), and advising AI companies on devrel. 

I did DevRel at Twilio for nine years. During my time I led the Enterprise Evangelism and Developer Community teams. 

I live in Lower Hudson Valley, about 20 miles north of Manhattan. I'm super into [photography]() and [magic](https://baugues.com/doug).
