# Developer Relations in the Age of AI

  

# Questions

## AI Assisted Coding

- How do you build relationships with model providers to ensure your code and documentation are properly represented in training data?

- Could API providers create special endpoints for LLM agents to use products unauthenticated for testing purposes?

- How should backwards compatibility be prioritized now that LLMs may recommend older SDK versions they were trained on?

- How much does human developer experience matter now versus agentic developer experience?

- As a thought experiment: do traditional DevRel techniques still hold if you assume AI agents are the customers now? (eg, write blog posts, but assume AI is reading them, not humans. "Be everywhere and be awesome," but be where the training data is being collected. ) 

- Will there be an equivalent to Google AdWords for LLMs where companies pay for preferential treatment?
  
- How can you help developers understand the right prompts to give their IDE to integrate with your product? 
  
- Can MCP servers become the primary interface between your product and developer tools?

## Docs

- Should documentation be primarily markdown-based to be more easily consumed by LLMs?

- Is it a failure case to have a developer look at documentation at all in an AI-first world?

## Content

- How will technical content marketing evolve when LLMs can generate code for any service?

- Should DevRel teams focus more on systems and architecture guidance rather than implementation details?

- Is video content / YouTube becoming more important as a way to cut through AI-generated text content?

## Events

* How are T&E and Sponsorship budgets looking post-pandemic, post zero-interest rates? 
# Acquisition
 
- Where are developers now discovering tools and APIs if not through traditional search?
  
# Measurement

- How should devrel metrics change knowing that new SDK releases might not see immediate adoption?
