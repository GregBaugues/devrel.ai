# Developer Relations in the Age of AI

# Intro 

A bunch of questions and a few thoughts on how AI changes devrel playbooks. 

## General Questions

* How does AI change the devrel playbook from the 2010s? 

## AI Assisted Coding

- LLMs produce, almost by definition, “average code.”  Can you build relationships with model providers to ensure your code and documentation are properly represented in training data?

- How do you reduce friction of AI agents building against and using your APIs? 

- LLMs are trained on and will recommend outdated versions of your docs and SDKs. How do you think about backwards compatibility? 

- We’ve learned what human developer experience looks like. (Eg, frictionless signup, copy-pastable code, magical experience within minutes). What does a good agent developer experience look like? 

- As a thought experiment: do traditional DevRel techniques still hold if you assume AI agents are the customers now? (eg, write blog posts, but assume AI is reading them, not humans. Have good docs, but maybe as markdown instead of HTML. "Be everywhere and be awesome," but be where the training data is being collected: GitHub repos, Reddit, etc)

- Will there be an equivalent to Google AdWords for LLMs where companies pay for preferential treatment?

- How can you help developers understand the right prompts to give their IDE to integrate with your product?

- Can MCP servers become the primary interface between your product and developer tools?


## Docs

- Should documentation be primarily markdown-based to be more easily consumed by LLMs?

- Is it a failure case to have a developer look at documentation at all?  

## Content

- developers use to Google, eg, “send sms in ruby” and land on your blog. Now they will solve that problem in the IDE. How does this affect your technical blog strategy? 

- do you still need to write blog posts with copy-pastable code, or is the value more high-level now: systems and architecture guidance rather than implementation details?

- Is video content / YouTube becoming more important as a way to cut through AI-generated text content?

## Events

* How are T&E and Sponsorship budgets looking post-pandemic, post zero-interest rates?
## Acquisition

- Where are developers now discovering tools and APIs if not through traditional search?

## Measurement

- How should devrel metrics change knowing that new SDK releases might not see immediate adoption?
