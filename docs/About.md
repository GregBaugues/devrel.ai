# About DevRel.ai

Hi! I'm Greg Baugues. 

I worked on Twilio's Developer Relations teams from 2014-2023. Since leaving, I've been building with AI, and advising AI companies on developer relations. 

 The DevRel playbook that worked in 2014 is not the same as today. How does AI  change the way we will do docs, technical blogs, developer experience, hackathons, etc?

I’m fascinated by these questions. I don’t pretend to know all the answers, but I have some thoughts, and a bunch of smart friends.
