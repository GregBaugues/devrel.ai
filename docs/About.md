# About DevRel.ai

Hi! I'm Greg Baugues. 

I worked on Twilio's Developer Relations teams from 2014-2023. Since leaving, I've been building with AI and advising AI companies on developer relations. 

 The DevRel playbook that worked in 2014 is not the same playbook that works today. AI is changing so many of the developer relations tactics: docs, developer acquisition, technical content, IRL events. 

This site is where I log, "What does Developer Relations look like in the age of AI?"
