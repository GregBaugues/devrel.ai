# How to maintain docs for large orgs


Twilio had an interesting documentation challenge. The company became known and successful for its first two original products - the SMS API and voice API. These were what most customers wanted to build with.

We needed to keep those front and center. However, as the company grew and expanded its target markets, the product portfolio also expanded.

What started as just two icons on the website (one with a little text message and one with a little phone call) suddenly became 20 icons. Not all these products had the same level of depth and complexity.

Beyond SMS and voice, not all products would be relevant to the average developer who visited our site.

Creating excellent documentation was already challenging with just two core APIs. The problem became much harder once the company started growing and adding more products.

I remember realizing that no single developer who visited our site would ever use all of these products. This was a big shift in how we helped developers find the information they needed without getting distracted or overwhelmed.

The most interesting aspect was how our approach changed over the years. When Twilio first built the developer education team, there were only three of us, while the rest of Twilio had about 550 employees.

In the beginning, we recognized we would never be able to write all the docs that Twilio needed, especially considering the granular nuances of specific API endpoints, operations, and edge cases.

With the expanding product portfolio, multiple programming languages, and different types of documentation, the scope was too much for three people.

We focused on creating tools internally that allowed our colleagues in product and engineering to contribute to the docs easily. This worked well for the first few years.

Twilio still had many product and engineering folks from the earlier era who expected to contribute to documentation. They knew this was an important responsibility for both their success and the company's success.

As the company grew larger, everyone's individual job scope narrowed. New hires might not have been expected to contribute to documentation before, and some expected to delegate it to technical writers.

This created an internal challenge from a cultural and organizational perspective. We had these "in-between years" where some product managers and engineers still felt that original ethos and wanted to be hands-on with their docs.

Meanwhile, other product teams had zero interest and expected us to do all the work for them. This made it difficult to staff the team and determine what types of tools to build.

By the time I left the company at the 5,000+ employee scale, few product teams were deeply involved in their docs. We focused on being great stewards of the documentation ourselves.

This involved creating excellent internal tooling for the professionals involved with the docs, as well as tools for auto-generating as much of the documentation as possible. There was still plenty of interesting engineering work in this approach.
