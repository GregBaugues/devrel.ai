# Developer Documentation at Twilio

**This is based on a conversation from Andrew Baker, who led the Developer Education Team at Twilio prior to serving as Twilio's VP of Developer Relations.** 

Twilio had a reputation for great docs even before we had a dedicated Developer Education team. 

That's because there was just such a — what I describe these days as a religious leap of faith on the core hypothesis of the company: you can build a company around an API as your product and a developer as your customer. 

When the company was really small, that meant that every engineer, and every product manager at Twilio was contributing to the documentation and saw it as a critical, necessary part of that leap of faith that underpinned the whole company. 

As the company grew, we had the opportunity to create a dedicated docs team dive headfirst into this "documentation as a product" mentality. 

But back then there wasn't really a lot of prior art on how you would do that. 

We had to start at first principles in terms of figuring out, as engineers: 

* What do we think are the best docs experiences we've encountered? 
* What do we think are the best libraries and open source tools we can draw inspiration from? 
* How can we figure out the right balance between helping a developer who's brand new get to that magical moment of lighting up their own device with code they wrote themselves, even if they copied and pasted most of it from the website? 
* How can we nail that first experience in as few minutes on the clock as possible, while still showing them enough of the rest of the complexity of the product so that they can say, "Oh yeah, I will be able to build the rest of my use case that I have in mind. I know where I'll have to go to get the information I need to actually finish building my product and launch it." 

That's kind of the scope of what we considered ourselves responsible for on the Developer Education team — that moment between when a developer signs up to get their API key for the first time through that first five minutes with the product where we're hoping to give them that magical moment, all the way up to when they've scoped out, planned their project, finished building their Twilio implementation — weeks, maybe months later — and they're launching it live in production to their end users and seeing everything work correctly. 

We built out ancillary functions like training and other things on the Developer Education over the years, but documentation was always the single most important pillar in supporting developers on that journey.
