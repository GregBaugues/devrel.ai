We struggled for years to name that persona—maybe "builder" is the best term. It refers to someone creating something from nothing, though they might not call themselves an engineer if you asked. 

Twilio's simplicity, plus its magical outcome, allowed us to meet lots of folks taking their first steps into software. They changed their view of their work, careers, and what's possible—realizing they could create a product and share it overnight.

The really interesting thing to watch is the different motivations those new "builders" might bring. Even just a few years ago, the conventional bootstrapper wisdom was: Find a small niche, keep things manageable, and marketable. Larger projects required outside funding, and that narrowed your available options, dictated by investor expectations. 

What excites me now is that it might be possible for one or a small group of people to ship a world-class, transformative technology product without capital that would have been necessary before. If you once needed 100 people, maybe now you can do it with 3, 5, or 10. With the right group, different motivations (not just maximizing investor returns) could drive hard work and innovation—paying the bills but not just chasing VC scale. 

That's my off-kilter dream for what this moment means: A new way for small groups to build what was previously out of reach.
