There is some artistry and a lot of thoughtfulness that can go into great documentation which really like conveys understanding for your audience in a way that I think, you know, can help them learn ancillary skills along the way.

How many times have we seen a developer's first API that they ever use be the Twilio API? We weren't just teaching them how to send a text message, we were teaching them how to make an API call and what it means to put an API key into your environment and things like that.

The empowering aspect of human consumed documentation is something I hope can get preserved somehow. But in terms of parsing through a dozen pages on some new website that I've never used before to understand what I need to do to make the right API call with the right parameters and what the response value is going to be that comes back, that was tedious, slow work.
