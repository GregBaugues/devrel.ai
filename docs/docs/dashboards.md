High-friction signup experiences are more frustrating than they used to be. 

Developers don't want to get to know your dashboard and console. They want to get an API key so that their coding agent can finish implementing the thing that it already got started on.

I'm not eloquent about this, but it feels like we've always valued dashboards as visual, but actually, dashboards can be obstacles—I'd rather have a conversation with my data, enabled by MCP and observability integrations.

## Andrew Baker

Yes, exactly. Even at Twilio, while we prioritized great documentation, we didn't put as much emphasis on customer dashboards, and that eventually caused trouble for us. Nobody enjoys maintaining or navigating a weird UI, so dashboards are ripe for rethink.

## Greg Baugues

So, the goal at Twilio wasn't "great docs" but "great developer experience." Docs were integral, but now agentic-first tooling matters more—it may not look like pretty docs or dashboards, but more like a single Markdown file or easily-executed curl commands. Helping the developer do what they want as quickly as possible may not involve visiting your website at all.
