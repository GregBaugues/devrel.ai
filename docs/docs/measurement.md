Back then, it was literally impossible for any user to become a Twilio customer without using the docs.

That was the more important metric I would highlight internally: not traffic or pageviews, but that 100% of revenue started with the docs. 

The docs played a critical role in attracting traffic to our site, even before someone decided to try building with our product. We could honestly say that every customer needed this resource to work well for them to succeed.
